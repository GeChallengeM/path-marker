There are two categories:
- Active path: Highlights your currently active path.
- Hover-path: Highlights the path you'd do if you would leftclick.
### Config options:
- Display: Always, Never, While keybind pressed, Toggle on keybind
- Draw location(s): Game map, Minimap, Both
- Draw mode: Full path, Target tile
- Keybind: sets the keybind for the Display setting
- Main tile color: the color of the path's tiles you're going to visit
- Secondary tile color: the color of the path's tiles you're going to "skip" due to running over them
- Tile fill opacity: determines the opacity of the path's tiles
- Draw only if no active path: stops the hover-path from being drawn if there's an active path
